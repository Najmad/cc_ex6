### Motivation
We pick several different topics articles from 3 different new sites.  
We want to analyze the articles and find out what's the top popular words in news.  

### What we've done
1. make them lowercase
2. get rid of symbols and digits
3. get rid of stopwords. (stopwords list from: http://www.ranks.nl/stopwords)
4. split the tokens by space
5. construct a dictionary and word counts
6. find out the top 5 popular words
7. display the top 5 words in the middle of canvas
8. display other words around them
