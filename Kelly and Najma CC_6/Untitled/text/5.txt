The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services has cleared actor Brad Pitt of allegations of physical abuse in connection with an incident aboard a private jet in September, multiple sources familiar with the investigations told NBC News Wednesday.
The sources said the allegations were not substantiated after interviews with family members — including the children — and a review of the facts in the case, a process which can take weeks.

One source added that the DCFS findings in relation to the incident does not mean the family is without need for treatment guided by mandated reporters of child abuse and neglect.
A DCFS spokesman told NBC News that the agency is prohibited by state law from breaching confidentiality by commenting on cases or individuals involved in them.
"Confidentiality laws exist to spare families undue public attention while they seek to resolve sensitive family issues," Neil J. Zanville said in a statement. "During the course of a child abuse investigation, we work closely with families to address those issues that may negatively impact child safety and well-being."
The investigation stemmed from an incident in September aboard a private plane carrying Pitt, Angelina Jolie and their children en route from Europe to Los Angeles that made a refueling stop in Minnesota.
The FBI is also involved in the case but has not commented publicly on whether their evaluation of the facts in the case has been completed.
Citing irreconcilable differences, Jolie has filed for divorce against Pitt. She is seeking physical custody of the children — Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and 8-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox — with joint legal custody and visitation for Pitt.
